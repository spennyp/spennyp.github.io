                            I started with a 3D pendulum system, the pendulum has massless string of length $l_1$ tied to the ceiling and a point mass $m_1$on the other end as shown in Figure 1.
                            This is a pretty good appriximation if you imagine a small bottle of ink held by a string tied to a fixed point. The idea is that there is a slow leak in the ink
                            that is falling onto plane $A$ below, which is parallel to the xy plane. Plane $A$ is where the magic occurs, you could imagine $A$ is a piece of paper. I will refer to this pendulum system as "System 1".

                            </figure>

                            <p>
                            If we give the mass some initial velocity $\vec{v_o}$, and an initial position $\vec{r_o}$, we can then solve for the motion of $m_1$ using Lagrangian mechanics.
                            This motion will produce a pattern due to the leaking ink hitting the plane $A$. I neglected the velocity of the ink leaving the bottle for simplicity sake, and took
                            the projection of the position of $m_1$ onto plane A to be the position where the ink falls. Air friction was also neglected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Now, this will form a pretty boring picture of concentric elipses on plane $A$.
                            To make things more interesing I tied plane $A$ to a the top side of a second pendulum of length $l_2$ to the the pivot point $O$ with mass $m_2$ on one end, and lenght $l_3$ from $O$ to point $P$ which is the origin of plane $A$ as shown in figure 3. 
                            The mass of plane $A$ is assumed to be zero here, which you could image if it were a piece of paper. Also $A$ is assumed to be kept parallel to the xy-plane at all time, one could enforce this with a ball joint and some control.
                            I will call this pendulum system, "System 2".

                            I will solve each system independently, and as it turns out I will only need to solve System 1 as the result will generalize for System 2.

                            <p>
                            Start by noting there are 2 degrees of freedom ($s=2$), I will pick my genrealized coordinates to be $\mathbf{q}=(\theta, \phi)$, note that because the results from System 1 will be the same as that from System 2 I will not use the subscripted angles.
                            Writing the cartesion position in terms of $\mathbf{q}$ we have (where the dot above implies the time derivative)

                            The potential energy is found to be $U = -mglcos(\theta)$, thus we find the Lagrangian to be

                            Noting that the Lagrangian is indepent of $t$ and $\phi$ we find that energy and angular momentum in the $\phi$ direction are conserved

                            In the simulation I solve this system of ODE's numerically, finding $\theta(t)$ and $\phi(t)$. 
                            From here $(x,y,z)$ can easily be found using the first 3 equations in the solution section.

                            Now it is time to consider System 2, as mentioned the physics will behave exactly as calculated for System 1. 
                            System 2 will be accounted for by the translation of plane $A$ in the xy-direction. 
                            Here the $z$ translation doesn't need to be considered as I am taking the position of the falling ink to be the projection onto the $A$ plane (neglecting the velocity of the ink leaving the bottle).
                            The translation of point $P$ (the origin of plane $A$) in the cordinate system for System 1 (and System 2) is
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn5.gif">
                            By applying this transformation to the position of $m_1$ in from System 1 we can find the position where the ink will fall on plane $A$ which has $P$ as its origin.
                            Thus the position of the ink drop on plane $A$ relative to origin $P$ will be
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn6.gif">
                            Where $x_p$ and $y_p$ are defined as drawn in figure 4.

                            </figure>
                            This is the equation that will gouvern the pattern drawn on $A$ for the complete system, which is plotted in the simulation.

                            To solve this problem the first step is to find the numerical solutions to the ODE's from the EL equations.
                            From the conservation of angular momentum in $\phi$ we can note that 
                            <img class="equationInline" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn7.gif">
                            which allows decoupling      of the ODE's to give a single ODE
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn8.gif">
                            We can then discretize this ODE to give
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn9.gif">
                            where $\Delta{t}$ is a small time step. So if we know two initial positions, we can find all further positions.
                            $\theta_0 = \theta(0)$ will be given as an inital condition, which just leaves the task to find $\theta_1 = \theta(\Deltat)$.
                            This can be found by taking the 2nd order taylor expansion about $\theta_{0}$
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn10.gif">
                            Manipulating <img class="equationInline" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn7.gif"> and discritizing gives
                            <img class="equation" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn11.gif">
                            This means we now have the equations that will allows a numerical solution. Notice that in these equations there is 
                            singularity about $\theta = 0$, this occurs due to a centrifugal barrier and is a product of solving these in spherical coordinates. 
                            There is more complex numerical methods to elimate this singularity but they are beyond the scope of this project. 
                            These equations will accuratly represent the system as long as $\theta$ is not to small, which is sufficent for the art I am trying to produce!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To solve these equations we will need to be provided 4 initial conditions
                                <img class="equationInline" src="../img/projects/pendulumHarmonograph/eqn12.gif">.
                                I want to demonstrate how the plots look in 3D and the projection onto a 2D surface which would be the art produced if A is held fixed.
                                To do so I implemented this algorithm and plotted for a few different initial conditions in Matlab, results can be seen in Figure 5. You can find the code on my <a href="https://github.com/spennyp/spennyp.github.io/tree/master/pendulumSimulation">github</a>

                            Now all that is left is to add in System 2, thankfully we can use the exact same discretized equations to solve for $\theta_2, \phi_2$
                            which allow us to solve for $(p_x, p_y)$ and what we really need $(x_p, y_p)$ which are the positins of the ink within plane A.

                        Once I proved the concept worked in Matlab, I moved it over to a javascript appliation to be run in the browser so 
                        it is interactive and easily accessible. I wanted a realivily clean and intuitive interface so I cut back the user specified 
                        values to just the angular velocity initial conditions, and the drawing time. The angular velocity initial condiiton were found 
                        (after some testing in Matlab) to have the biggest impact on the resulting art produced. The simulation as seen in Figure 8, can be found 
                        <a href="../pendulumSimulation/pendulum.html">here</a> (it is also linked in the disclaimer at the top, and in the discussion).

                        <p>
                        Within the simulation I added 2 different animations which the user can toggle on and off:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Animation in time: This allows the user to visualize how the painting gets made from the start to end by drawing it infront of their eyes. The user can change how far along the painting is with the time slider.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Harmonics animation: This animation runs through some values of initial conditions, slowing down around some harmonics that produce
                                a cool painting. This should give the user an intuitive feel of how they can use the simulation to create their own art. Note that the sliders are also animated in time
                                so the user can see exactly what paramenters are being changed!
                            </li>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that it can be a bit tricky to find nice harmonics (a lot of the time it just looks like scribbbles), but just keep chaning the initial conditions and they will appear. If all else fails run the harmonic animation and stop it when you hit something you like.
                        </p>

                            Most importantly please have fun and enjoy producing cool art! This is a really great way for someone who is not typically great at art to be an

                        When I first set out to solve this problem I was not sure if I was actually going to be able to produce a harmonograph, but was pleasently surprised! 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        A traditional harmonograph drawing gets it beauty from the damping in the pendulum motion due to 
                        air resistance, where in my case it was neglected. Also in a tradition harmongraph, there are 3 pendulums; a planar pendulum in the xz plane, another in the yz plane,
                        and the last is a spherical pendulum set in conical motion moving the canvas. This means it is easy to tune frequencies in the xz and yz direction independtly, where as in my
                        harmonograph this isn't as easy due to the coupled ODE's that arrise. This makes it slightly more difficult to find initial conditions
                        that produce a nice result, which means I get more of the "art" found in figure 9 than a typical haramongraph would, but all things considerd it turned out really well!
